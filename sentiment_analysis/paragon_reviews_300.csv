"31 July 2023","4","Timeless Charm, Excellent Service, Amazing Food, Unbeatable Prices!","One of the oldest restaurants in town, I was instantly transported back in time with its charming old interiors.

The service was simply outstanding, as the staff was attentive and courteous in spite of the heavy rush, there were at least a 50 people waiting...outside to get in. And everyone got a smile from the staffs.

Now, let's talk about the food. The food was beyond amazing! Prepared with authentic flavors, the biriyani was so good that my kids just loved it.
The most delightful surprises, they had Vegetable biriyani and i didnt leave a tiny grain of rice behind. Every bite was a pure delight.

What impressed me the most was the unbelievable affordability. Despite its longstanding reputation and excellent service, the prices were incredibly cheap.

It's a place where time slows down, and you can savor both history and culinary artistry.

I can't recommend it highly enough, and I'm already looking forward to my next visit!More"
"31 May 2023","5","Great place for non-veg Kerala food in Kozhikode, a place not to be missed.","Been here for breakfast and late lunch on our way to Wayanad from Kozhikode and back. 

Breakfast was extraordinary. We ordered Appam, Idiappam, Chicken curry, Veggie stew, Parotta and a Pazham Pori. Except Idiappam, everything tasted great. Idiappam was a little soggy. We thoroughly enjoyed...the breakfast. 

Two days later, we were at the same place for lunch, somewhat late in the afternoon like 4:30PM. We ordered Nei Choru, Parottas, Fish Fry, Chicken curry and Fish Curry. All tasted good, particularly the fish fry was quite unique and tasted extremely good. It was like I never had it anywhere else, except one Malayali restaurant in Chennai called Kumarakom which is not that famous anymore. 

The building and ambiance looks old, but kept neat and clean. Surprisingly the breakfast was pretty cheap, like Rs. 400 for 3 people. The lunch was quite expensive, due to the fish dishes we ordered, still its worth the money. 

I would strongly recommend this place for anyone landing in Kozhikode for anytime, breakfast, lunch or dinner. This is both cost effective and tasty. I will never miss it whenever I visit Kozhikode.More"
"15 May 2023","5","Best restaurant since 1939","Paragon is a Kozhikode institution with an unmatched cuisine with awesome taste 

It’s maintained it’s standards over the last 18 years the first time i got to visit 

There will be a significant waiting time most of the days specially during the vacation time but...hats off to the staff and the customers who display patience and wait their turn

There are other outlets in Focus Mall, Gulf countries and now Bengaluru

The management could look at expanding the capacity to reduce the waiting timeMore"

We ordered neichoru, fish with mango curry, prawn roast, mutton biriyani - and each item was to die for. All the meat and seafood was fresh. How the restaurant manages to retain the right taste, especially with consistency given the volumes that have to cater for, is amazing. The service was top class and very proactive.
